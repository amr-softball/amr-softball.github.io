Following attempts to install Windows, this is as far as I\textquotesingle{}ve got (not very far -\/ I wouldn\textquotesingle{}t recommend trying)...


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download Tortoise\+S\+VN and clone the latest Chombo to /\+Users/myusername/chombo
\item Install chocolatey \mbox{[}\href{https://chocolatey.org/install}{\tt https\+://chocolatey.\+org/install}\mbox{]}. I did the powershell version, after first launching an administrative powershell -\/ installation is achieved through one line of code, as provided on their website.
\item Install {\ttfamily make} through chocolatey\+: {\ttfamily choco install make}... but it didn\textquotesingle{}t let me compile Chombo...
