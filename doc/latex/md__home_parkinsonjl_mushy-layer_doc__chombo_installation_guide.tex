This is an attempt at listing the steps required to install Chombo on a unix system. It likely contains various holes where I forgot I had done something to get it working -\/ please send any additions or corrections to \mbox{[}\href{mailto:jamie.parkinson@gmail.com}{\tt jamie.\+parkinson@gmail.\+com}\mbox{]}, thanks.

To start with, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to satisfy the prerequisites listed in {\ttfamily Chombo/doc/\+Chombo\+Design.\+pdf}. In particular, you\textquotesingle{}ll need Fortran compilers and C++ compilers that are sufficiently up to date.

\section*{Fortran}

gfortran works well on Ubuntu, my installation looks like


\begin{DoxyCode}
parkinsonjl@atmlxlap005:~$ gfortran --version
GNU Fortran (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.4) 4.8.4
\end{DoxyCode}


\section*{C++ compiler}

Make sure you have a sufficient compiler version. Mine looks like


\begin{DoxyCode}
parkinsonjl@atmlxlap005:~$ mpicc --version
gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.4) 4.8.4
\end{DoxyCode}


\section*{H\+D\+F5}

The latest version of hdf5 (1.\+10.\+xx) doesn\textquotesingle{}t seem to work with Chombo at the moment. You can download the source code for version 1.\+8.\+21 from \mbox{[}\href{https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/HDF5+1.8.21#files}{\tt https\+://portal.\+hdfgroup.\+org/display/support/\+H\+D\+F5+1.\+8.\+21\#files}\mbox{]}, which does work. There are decent install instructions in {\ttfamily release\+\_\+docs/\+I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L\+\_\+parallel}. Download the files, extract them, then install like


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ cd /path/to/hdf5-1.8.21/
$ ./configure --enable-parallel --prefix=/home/parkinsonj/soft/hdf5/
$ make
$ make check
$ make install
\end{DoxyCode}


Make sure you use the {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/parallel} option with configure.

Once installed make sure you set the evironment variable

{\ttfamily L\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+R\+Y\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH=/path/to/hdf5/lib/} e.\+g. {\ttfamily L\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+R\+Y\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH=/home/parkinsonj/soft/hdf5/lib/}.

Do this in your .bashrc or whatever gets called whenever you open a terminal so it\textquotesingle{}s always there.

\section*{Chombo}

Chombo download instructions are available at \mbox{[}\href{https://anag-repo.lbl.gov/chombo-3.2/access.html}{\tt https\+://anag-\/repo.\+lbl.\+gov/chombo-\/3.\+2/access.\+html}\mbox{]}. You need to register for an account, then you can get the code using svn\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ svn --username username co https://anag-repo.lbl.gov/svn/Chombo/trunk/   /your/path/to/chombo/
\end{DoxyCode}


Then you need to make a {\ttfamily /lib/mk/\+Make.defs.\+local} file for your system. I am using the following options\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
DIM           = 2            # 3 also works
DEBUG         = FALSE        # true also works
OPT           = TRUE         # false also works
FC            = gfortran
MPI           = TRUE
MPICXX        = mpiCC
HDFINCFLAGS= -I/usr/local/hdf5-1.8.21p-v18/include
HDFLIBFLAGS= -L/usr/local/hdf5-1.8.21p-v18/lib -lhdf5 -lz 
USE\_HDF       = TRUE
HDFMPIINCFLAGS= -I/usr/local/hdf5-1.8.21p-v18/include
HDFMPILIBFLAGS= -L/usr/local/hdf5-1.8.21p-v18/lib -lhdf5 -lz 
flibflags     = -lblas -llapack -lgfortran 
LAPACKLIBS = -L/usr/lib -L/usr/lib/lapack -L/usr/lib/libblas -llapack  -lblas
\end{DoxyCode}


If the blas or lapack packages don\textquotesingle{}t exist, you may need to run something like {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install libblas-\/dev liblapack-\/dev}. These are tools for mainly doing linear algebra (inverting matrices etc.) very quickly.

\section*{Visit}

Visit is very useful for quickly visualising data. Download Visit from \mbox{[}\href{https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/source}{\tt https\+://wci.\+llnl.\+gov/simulation/computer-\/codes/visit/source}\mbox{]}. There are good install instructions supplied with the source code/on their website. Add your visit install location to your P\+A\+TH.

\section*{doxygen}

Doxygen let\textquotesingle{}s you build documentation from the source code (and the comments within it). It can be downloaded from \mbox{[}\href{http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html}{\tt http\+://www.\+doxygen.\+nl/download.\+html}\mbox{]}. Then go to the {\ttfamily /path/to/mushy-\/layer/doc} directory and run {\ttfamily doxygen} in a terminal -\/ it should pick up the {\ttfamily Doxyfile} already there, which specifies how to build the documentation.
